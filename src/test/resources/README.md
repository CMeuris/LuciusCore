# Test Data

This test data is derived from the [LINCS dataset](http://www.lincsproject.org/). 
We have transformed the data in the form we use internally on proprietary L1000 data.

The data used here comes from a project here:
<http://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/index.html#download> from the paper:

> Zichen Wang, Neil R. Clark, and Avi Ma'ayan (2016) Drug Induced Adverse Events
> Prediction with the LINCS L1000 Data Bioinformatics
> doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw168

Notes:
- A set of features of samples and compounds are not available for LINCS data,
  so we substituted with dummy data or placeholders.
- No known target information is available for the compounds in the LINCS
  dataset, so we inserted some dummy entries
- No `p`-values are available for the expression values (or derived stats), so
  we just put `p = 0.0` everywhere.
- We have only used the first 100 rows of the `t` and `p` database.
